# Price-Extractor


## Overview ðŸ“‹

1.RNNs are a type of neural network that are well-suited for processing sequential data, such as text. They can be trained to recognize patterns in the input string, such as the structure of a price. However, training an RNN can be computationally expensive and may require a large amount of data to achieve high accuracy.

2.Multinomial Bayes, on the other hand, is a simple algorithm that can be used for text classification. It is based on Bayes' theorem and can be used to classify text into different categories, such as "price" or "non-price". Training a Multinomial Bayes model is relatively straightforward and it can be done with relatively small amounts of data.

3.Both models have their own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the situation and the type of data. RNNs may be more accurate in complex situations where the prices have a variety of regex forms. But Multinomial Bayes may be faster and more efficient in situations where the prices are straightforward and the dataset is smaller.

4.It would be best to evaluate and test both models on your specific dataset to determine which one is more accurate. Additionally, you can consider to use ensemble models that combines the predictions of both models to achieve a higher accuracy.
